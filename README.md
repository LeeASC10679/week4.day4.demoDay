# week4.day4.demoDay

## Instructions
1. This will be the last project of the Summer Intensive. 
2. Your group has 3 project options to choose from. 
3. This project is broken into 2 parts:
   - You must **pitch** your idea to the instructional team, and only after passing should you go on to coding the project. Review the [Demo Day Pitch Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bRiXIcDazGmnaDFUOsVreXa8hbbYm1hjHGAtaYYVI4w/edit?usp=sharing), since that’s what your instructors will be using!
   - On one of the last days of the Summer Intensive, you will be **presenting** your project to an audience of parents, ASC staff, donors, and other partners. Review the [Demo Day Presentation Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lZmMsbO583hzSZNuIXWpXNuj07sx3aChG7pQ8erZiOc/edit?usp=sharing).
4. Create a mobile web app that does **one** of the following:
   - addresses a problem you see in your community
   - saves the user money (even 1 cent counts!)
   - addresses a social justice issue. Some issues include, but are not limited to:
     - Poverty
     - The environment
     - Access to education
     - Access to Health Care
     - Inequality (sex, race, nationality)
   - *Note: Games are OK! Typically, one cohort will have 1 or 2 groups making a game-based app, and that’s perfectly fine! But any more than that and we’ll generally ask groups to brainstorm other options to ensure diversity in Demo Day presentations.*
5. Since you’re making a mobile web app…
   - The website should be responsive (properly viewable from a mobile device)
   - You should have a properly hosted website (feel free to use GitHub!)
6. Here’s a basic schedule for the Demo Day Projects:
   - **Day 1** - Brainstorm ideas for a final project. Pitch your best idea to the instructional staff. Once approved you can go on to work on the project. You SHOULD be approved by the end of the first day to give you the most time to work on your project.
   - **Days 2-4** - Work on your project! If you “feel” done, then your group should be practicing, practicing, practicing! Anticipate things not going according to plan; have backups in place! 
     - If someone’s out sick, who can take over their part?
     - If the wifi doesn’t work, can you run you project locally?
     - The audience can ask questions. Be prepared to answer tough questions like:
       - How is your app going to make money?
         - Saying you’ll let business run ads in your app isn’t going to cut it
         - Have a feasible business model in mind, even if your current version is free
       - How do you plan to compete with other similar apps?
       - What will be done to address any technical limitations of your app?
   - **Day 5 (Demo Day)** - No more coding! You’re done coding (hard code and hack if you have to, but this day is for practicing)! Tighten up your presentation as much as you can. Remember these projects do not need to be perfect or even 100% operational; you were given an INSANE deadline (~5 days) to put a large project together. *Dare Greatly, Celebrate Failure, and Tell Your Story!*
